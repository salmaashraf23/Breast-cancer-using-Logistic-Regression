The Breast Cancer Classification project typically involves using machine learning to diagnose breast cancer based on a set of features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The most commonly used dataset for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

Dataset Details:
Features:

There are 30 features (all numeric) that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Some of these features include:
Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
Symmetry
Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
Classes:

Malignant: Cancerous tumors.
Benign: Non-cancerous tumors.

Objective:
The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately classify tumors as either benign or malignant based on the provided features
